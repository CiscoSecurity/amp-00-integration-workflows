Ingest Events
=============

Streaming API (Preferred)
-------------------------

`AMP for Endpoints Streaming API <https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_resources/EventStream?api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_version=v1>`_

The AMP for Endpoints Streaming API is used to collect events from AMP for Endpoints. It is based on AMQP 0.9.1 and is implemented using
`Rabbit MQ <https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html>`_. Communication with with the streaming API requires
an AMQP client, a list of clients libraries can be found `here <https://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html>`_.

- The passive and durable bits should be set on the queue
- The protocol is over SSL/TLS.

The events in an event stream can be received using a persistent connection or queried on an interval. When using a
persistent connection the client will connect to the stream and wait for events to be generated. When the events are
generated they will be consumed immediately. If queried on an interval the events will sit in the queue waiting to be
consumed. When the client connects it will consume all of the events in the queue and then close the connection. Events
will sit in the queue for 10 days maximum, at which point they will be deleted.

An event can only be consumed by a single consumer. If multiple consumers are connected to the same event stream, the
events will be divided between them in no particular order. It is not recommended to have more than one consumer
connected to a given event stream.

Create Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Customers must create an Event Stream using the following `request <https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_actions/details?api_action=POST+%2Fv1%2Fevent_streams&api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_resource=EventStream&api_version=v1>`_.

.. code::

    POST /v1/event_streams

.. http:example::

    POST https://api.amp.cisco.com/v1/event_streams HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic MTIzNDphdGVzdA==

They have the options of specifying which `event types <https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_actions/details?api_action=GET+%2Fv1%2Fevent_types&api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_resource=Event+Type&api_version=v1>`_
they would like in the stream as well as which `groups <https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_actions/details?api_action=GET+%2Fv1%2Fgroups&api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_resource=Group&api_version=v1>`_
they would like to receive events from. Organizations are limited to a maximum of 5 event streams.

The credentials for an event stream are only provided at time of creation. If they are not stored at this point in time
there is no ability to retrieve or reset the credentials for the stream. The stream will have to be deleted and a new
stream with the same settings will have to be created.

`Example Duplicate Stream Script <https://github.com/CiscoSecurity/amp-04-duplicate-event-stream>`_


Connect to Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any AMQP 0.9.1 client can be used to connect to the stream. You can find an example in Ruby in the API documentation
`here <https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_actions/details?api_action=POST+%2Fv1%2Fevent_streams&api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_resource=EventStream&api_version=v1>`_.
There is an example implementation in Python using Pika to connect to a stream that can be found in the example below:

`Example Stream Consumer <https://github.com/Cisco-AMP/pika_bootstrap>`_

Delete Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Customers can delete an Event Stream using the following `request <https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_actions/details?api_action=DELETE+%2Fv1%2Fevent_streams%2F%7B%3Aid%7D&api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_resource=EventStream&api_version=v1>`_.

.. code::

    DELETE /v1/event_streams/{:id}

.. http:example::

    DELETE https://api.amp.cisco.com/v1/event_streams/{:id} HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic MTIzNDphdGVzdA==

`Example Delete Stream Script <https://github.com/CiscoSecurity/amp-04-delete-event-stream>`_

Correlating Events
------------------

In the AMP for Endpoints UI a Quarantine event (success or failure) is correlated with a Threat Detected event. The UI
combines these into a single event making it easy for users to see which things to focus on. In the API these events are
separated. To correlate Threat Detected with Quarantined actions you have to track ``.data[].detection_id``. The value
is returned as a string.

Correlating these events together makes for a much better user experience as it allows to the user to differentiate
between a quarantined threat that poses a less immediate risk and a threat that may still be on the machine. There are
multiple event types that can all have the same ``detection_id`` for a detection. Examples of these events are:

+-------------------------------------+---------------+
| Event Name                          | Event Type ID |
+-------------------------------------+---------------+
| Threat Detected                     | 1090519054    |
+-------------------------------------+---------------+
| Threat Quarantined                  | 553648143     |
+-------------------------------------+---------------+
| Quarantine Failure                  | 2164260880    |
+-------------------------------------+---------------+
| Cloud Recall Detection              | 553648147     |
+-------------------------------------+---------------+
| Cloud Recall Quarantine Successful  | 553648155     |
+-------------------------------------+---------------+

The integration should combine these events events based on the ``.data[].detection_id`` field.  It is possible for a
single detection to have a Threat Detected, Threat Quarantine, and a Quarantine Failure. These events may be returned in
the API in any order.

The following event JSON shows the correlation of the ``detection_id`` value of 6533241145273614338:

Grouping Events
---------------

When creating incidents from AMP for Endpoints events, grouping the events that occur within a defined time period helps
reduce alert fatigue. Here are three common scenarios that can be used to group events.

Same Detection (Hash) on Multiple Endpoints in N Time Period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming N time period is 5 minutes the following "events" would be in one incident:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {"sha256":"8ed3f6ad685b959ead7022518e1af76cd816f8e8ec7ccdda1ed4018e8f2223f8", "date":"2019-09-19T18:00:00+00:00", "computer":"alpha"}
    {"sha256":"8ed3f6ad685b959ead7022518e1af76cd816f8e8ec7ccdda1ed4018e8f2223f8", "date":"2019-09-19T18:00:23+00:00", "computer":"bravo"}
    {"sha256":"8ed3f6ad685b959ead7022518e1af76cd816f8e8ec7ccdda1ed4018e8f2223f8", "date":"2019-09-19T18:02:47+00:00", "computer":"charlie"}
    {"sha256":"8ed3f6ad685b959ead7022518e1af76cd816f8e8ec7ccdda1ed4018e8f2223f8", "date":"2019-09-19T18:03:51+00:00", "computer":"delta"}
    {"sha256":"8ed3f6ad685b959ead7022518e1af76cd816f8e8ec7ccdda1ed4018e8f2223f8", "date":"2019-09-19T18:04:44+00:00", "computer":"echo"}

The next "event" would go to a new incident:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {"sha256":"8ed3f6ad685b959ead7022518e1af76cd816f8e8ec7ccdda1ed4018e8f2223f8", "date":"2019-09-19T18:09:13+00:00", "computer":"foxtrot"}

Same Detection (Hash) on Multiple Endpoints on Same Endpoint in N Time Period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming N time period is 5 minutes the following "events" would be in one incident:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {"sha256":"f144a6907dc4284d1f9fe6a7d9b9ff53c02c1d07ba68f24d413d7ff7f757a782", "date":"2019-09-19T18:00:00+00:00", "computer":"golf"}
    {"sha256":"f144a6907dc4284d1f9fe6a7d9b9ff53c02c1d07ba68f24d413d7ff7f757a782", "date":"2019-09-19T18:00:23+00:00", "computer":"golf"}
    {"sha256":"f144a6907dc4284d1f9fe6a7d9b9ff53c02c1d07ba68f24d413d7ff7f757a782", "date":"2019-09-19T18:02:47+00:00", "computer":"golf"}
    {"sha256":"f144a6907dc4284d1f9fe6a7d9b9ff53c02c1d07ba68f24d413d7ff7f757a782", "date":"2019-09-19T18:03:51+00:00", "computer":"golf"}
    {"sha256":"f144a6907dc4284d1f9fe6a7d9b9ff53c02c1d07ba68f24d413d7ff7f757a782", "date":"2019-09-19T18:04:44+00:00", "computer":"golf"}

The next "event" would go to a new incident:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {"sha256":"f144a6907dc4284d1f9fe6a7d9b9ff53c02c1d07ba68f24d413d7ff7f757a782", "date":"2019-09-19T18:09:13+00:00", "computer":"golf"}

Multiple Detections (Hash or IP) on the Same Computer in N Time Period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming N time period is 5 minutes the following "events" would be in one incident:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {"sha256":"b9dd960c1753459a78115d3cb845a57d924b6877e805b08bd01086ccdf34433c", "date":"2019-09-19T18:00:00+00:00", "computer":"hotel"}
