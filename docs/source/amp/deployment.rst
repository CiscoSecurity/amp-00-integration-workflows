Managed Deployment Techniques
=============================

Deploy Agent
------------

Cisco AMP supports managed installs and has different command line flags/switches that can be used to customize agent
installation, which vary by operating system.

Windows
^^^^^^^

.. NOTE::

    Common flags and what they do:

    - /R: For all Connector versions 5.1.13 and higher this must be the first switch used.
    - /S: Used to put the installer into silent mode.
    - /skiptetra 1: Skip installation of the TETRA driver.
    - /skipdfc 1: Skip installation of the DFC driver.

    For more information please see Chapter 3 of Deployment Strategy Guide or Chapter 7 of the User Guide `here <https://console.amp.cisco.com/docs>`_.

Deploy Windows AMP for Endpoint With Default Switches
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When installing on a Windows Server/Domain Controller:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S /skiptetra 1 /skipdfc 1

When installing on Windows Desktops:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S

Deploy Windows AMP for Endpoint With No UI Elements
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When installing on a Windows Server/Domain Controller:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S /skiptetra 1 /skipdfc 1 /desktopicon 0 /startmenu 0 /contextmenu 0

When installing on Windows Desktops:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S /desktopicon 0 /startmenu 0 /contextmenu 0

Deploy Windows AMP for Endpoint and Specify the Installation Parameters
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To prompt a user for which command line switches they would like to use please see Chapter 3 of Deployment Strategy
Guide or Chapter 7 of the User Guide `here <https://console.amp.cisco.com/docs>`_ for a list of available command line
switches.

Upgrade Windows AMP for Endpoints Connector
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To upgrade the connector please read the command switches used during the previous installation from the following
local.xml files:

- ``/config/install/switches/skipdfc``
- ``/config/install/switches/skiptetra``
- ``/config/install/switches/skipexprevprereqcheck``
- ``/config/install/switches/desktopicon``
- ``/config/install/switches/startmenu``
- ``/config/install/switches/contextmenu``
- ``/config/install/switches/overridepolicy``

Read the command switches used during the previous installation from the local.xml. For example if the local.xml contained:

.. code::

    ...
      </agent>
      <install>
       <switches>
        <skipdfc>1</skipdfc>
        <desktopicon>0</desktopicon>
        <sendfile>1</sendfile>
        <versioncheck>0</versioncheck>
        <noadmin>0</noadmin>
        <skiposcheck>0</skiposcheck>
        <skiptetra>1</skiptetra>
        <contextmenu>0</contextmenu>
        <startmenu>0</startmenu>
        <trayicon>0</trayicon>
        <overridepolicy>1</overridepolicy>
        <skipexprevprereqcheck>0</skipexprevprereqcheck>
        <overrideinstpathlength>0</overrideinstpathlength>
        <renameinstalldir>1</renameinstalldir>
       </switches>
      </install>
      <janus>
    ...

Then you would use the following command to upgrade:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S /skipdfc 1 /skiptetra 1 /skipexprevprereqcheck 0 /desktopicon 0
    /startmenu 0 /contextmenu 0 /overridepolicy 1

Check Agent Status
------------------

Windows
^^^^^^^

Installation Status
"""""""""""""""""""

To confirm installation was successful look for a service that contains the string ``CiscoAMP``.

Connector Status
""""""""""""""""

To find the connector version and connector state for Windows computers with the AMP for Endpoints connector you first
check the version of a service that contains ``CiscoAMP``. Then, you check if a running service contains ``CiscoAMP``.

Linux
^^^^^

Installation Status
"""""""""""""""""""

To check if the AMP connector is installed check for the following file ``/opt/cisco/amp/bin/ampdaemon``.

Connector Status
""""""""""""""""

To find the connector version and connector state for Linux computers with the AMP for Endpoints connector you first
check ``/opt/cisco/amp/etc/global.xml`` for the version. Then, see if the service is running under a process named
``ampdaemon``.

MacOS

^^^^^

Go to here: ``/Library/Application Support/Cisco/AMP for Endpoints Connector/local.xml``

Read the value located here: ``/config/agent/uuid``

Uninstall
---------

Full Uninstall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This action will uninstall AMP for Endpoints and remove all data from disk. If you later re-install AMP on the computer
it will register with a new GUID.

Windows
"""""""

To remove AMP from Windows please do the following:

1. Find the directory path for the ``uninstall.exe`` ``%AMP_InstallDir\%VERSION`` by checking the image path of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints process. The Service name will be ``CiscoAMP_%VERSION``. The image path will be ``%AMP_InstallDir\%VERSION\sfc.exe``.
2. Navigate to the directory. Here is an example ``C:\Program Files\Cisco\AMP\7.2.7``.
3. Run the following command:

.. code::

    uninstall.exe /S /full 1 /password <PASSWORD>
