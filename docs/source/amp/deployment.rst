Managed Deployment Techniques
=============================

Deploy Agent
------------

Cisco AMP supports managed installs and has different command line flags/switches that can be used to customize agent
installation, which vary by operating system.

Windows
^^^^^^^

.. NOTE::

    Common flags and what they do:

    - /R: For all Connector versions 5.1.13 and higher this must be the first switch used.
    - /S: Used to put the installer into silent mode.
    - /skiptetra 1: Skip installation of the TETRA driver.
    - /skipdfc 1: Skip installation of the DFC driver.

    ``/skiptetra`` and ``/skipdfc`` are both binary switches where 0 is false/off and 1 is true/on. This logic applies to any command switch, as detailed in the documentation below.

    For more information please see Chapter 3 of Deployment Strategy Guide or Chapter 7 of the User Guide `here <https://console.amp.cisco.com/docs>`_.

Deploy Windows AMP for Endpoint
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When installing on a Windows Server/Domain Controller:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S /skiptetra 1 /skipdfc 1

When installing on Windows Desktops:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S

Deploy Windows AMP for Endpoint With No UI Elements
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When installing on a Windows Server/Domain Controller:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S /skiptetra 1 /skipdfc 1 /desktopicon 0 /startmenu 0 /contextmenu 0

When installing on Windows Desktops:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S /desktopicon 0 /startmenu 0 /contextmenu 0

Deploy Windows AMP for Endpoint and Specify the Installation Parameters
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For a complete list of command line switches that can be used during installation please see Chapter 3 of Deployment
Strategy Guide or Chapter 7 of the User Guide `here <https://console.amp.cisco.com/docs>`_. You can then prompt the user
for the value of each switch.

Upgrade Windows AMP for Endpoints Connector
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To upgrade the connector keeping the deployment settings you must read the command line switches used during the
previous installation from the ``local.xml``:

.. NOTE::

    The ``local.xml`` is found in Cisco AMP install directory which can be found by checking the registry key value of ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Immunet Protect\InstallDir``.

- ``/config/install/switches/skipdfc``
- ``/config/install/switches/skiptetra``
- ``/config/install/switches/skipexprevprereqcheck``
- ``/config/install/switches/desktopicon``
- ``/config/install/switches/startmenu``
- ``/config/install/switches/contextmenu``
- ``/config/install/switches/overridepolicy``

For example if the ``local.xml`` contained:

.. code::

    ...
      </agent>
      <install>
       <switches>
        <skipdfc>1</skipdfc>
        <desktopicon>0</desktopicon>
        <sendfile>1</sendfile>
        <versioncheck>0</versioncheck>
        <noadmin>0</noadmin>
        <skiposcheck>0</skiposcheck>
        <skiptetra>1</skiptetra>
        <contextmenu>0</contextmenu>
        <startmenu>0</startmenu>
        <trayicon>0</trayicon>
        <overridepolicy>1</overridepolicy>
        <skipexprevprereqcheck>0</skipexprevprereqcheck>
        <overrideinstpathlength>0</overrideinstpathlength>
        <renameinstalldir>1</renameinstalldir>
       </switches>
      </install>
      <janus>
    ...

Then you would use the following command to upgrade:

.. code::

    amp_GroupName.exe /R /S /skipdfc 1 /skiptetra 1 /skipexprevprereqcheck 0 /desktopicon 0
    /startmenu 0 /contextmenu 0 /overridepolicy 1


Linux
^^^^^

Deploy Linux AMP for Endpoint Connector
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For RHEL/CentOS versions 6-8 please go `here <https://console.amp.cisco.com/download_connector>`_ and select the group
you will be deploying a connector for. Next, select the distribution of Linux you will be using and copy the URL it
creates. Then, run the following two commands:

.. code::

    wget <CopiedURL> -o amp_<GroupName>_rhel-<LinuxDistribution>.rpm
    yum install -y amp_<GroupName>_rhel-<LinuxDistribution>.rpm

.. code::

    hdiutil attach amp_GroupName.dmg
    installer -pkg /Volumes/ampmac_connector/ciscoampmac_connector.pkg -target /
    hdiutil detach /Volumes/ampmac_connector



Check Agent Status
------------------

Windows
^^^^^^^

Installation Status
"""""""""""""""""""

To confirm installation was successful look for a service that contains the string ``CiscoAMP``.

Connector Status
""""""""""""""""

To find the connector state and version for Windows computers check for a running service that contains ``CiscoAMP``.
If a service exists you can then check the version of the service.

Linux
^^^^^

Installation Status
"""""""""""""""""""

To confirm if the AMP connector is installed check for the following file ``/opt/cisco/amp/bin/ampdaemon``.

Connector Status
""""""""""""""""

To find the connector state and version for Linux computers with the AMP for Endpoints connector you first check if
there is a running process named ``ampdaemon``. To get the version read the value of ``/Signature/Object/config/agent/version``
from ``/opt/cisco/amp/etc/global.xml``.

MacOS
^^^^^

Installation Status
"""""""""""""""""""

To check if the AMP connector is installed check for the following file ``/opt/cisco/amp/ampdaemon``.

Connector Status
""""""""""""""""

there is a running process named ``ampdaemon``. To get the version read the value of ``/Signature/Object/config/agent/version``
from ``/opt/cisco/amp/etc/global.xml``.

Get Agent GUID
--------------

Windows
^^^^^^^

To get the AMP InstallDir check the registry key value of ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Immunet Protect\InstallDir``.

Read the value of ``/config/agent/uuid`` from ``$AMP_InstallDir\local.xml``.

Default location is: ``C:\Program Files\Cisco\AMP\local.xml``

Linux
^^^^^

Read the value of ``/config/agent/uuid`` from ``/opt/cisco/amp/etc/local.xml``.

MacOS
^^^^^

Read the value of ``/config/agent/uuid`` from ``/Library/Application Support/Cisco/AMP for Endpoints Connector/local.xml``.

Uninstall
---------

Full Uninstall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This action will uninstall AMP for Endpoints and remove all data from disk. If you later re-install AMP on the computer
it will register with a new GUID.

Windows
"""""""

To remove AMP from Windows please do the following:

1. Find the directory path for the ``uninstall.exe`` ``%AMP_InstallDir\%VERSION`` by checking the image path of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints process. The Service name will be ``CiscoAMP_%VERSION``. The image path will be ``%AMP_InstallDir\%VERSION\sfc.exe``.
2. Navigate to the directory. Here is an example ``C:\Program Files\Cisco\AMP\7.2.7``.
3. Run the following command:

.. code::

    uninstall.exe /S /full 1 /password <PASSWORD>
